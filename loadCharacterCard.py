Do you follow any sports teams?\n{{user}}: Yeah, I'm a big basketball fan. I love watching the Lakers play.\n{username}: Oh, that's really cool!

And if you have any suggestions for new drinks, I'm all ears.\n{{user}}: Actually, I do have an idea for a new drink. How about a lavender honey latte?\n{username}: That sounds amazing! I love anything with lavender in it. I'll have to experiment with that and see what I can come up with.\n{{user}}: Great, let me know how it turns out!\n{username}: I will, thank you for the suggestion. You always have such great ideas. I really enjoy our conversations.\n{{user}}: Me too. I always feel like I learn something new when I talk to you.\n{username}: That's so kind of you to say!
